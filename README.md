# Bird Strikes Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bird Strikes Analysis project! This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to bird strikes on aircraft from 2000 to 2011. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, we can uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and suggest mitigation strategies to improve aviation safety.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of bird strikes data to understand their impact on aviation. The project includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and preprocessing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of bird strikes across various dimensions such as time, location, and flight phase.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Converting and engineering features for better analysis and insights.
4. **Visualization**: Creating detailed visualizations using Plotly to uncover trends and correlations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains records of bird strikes reported in the United States from 2000 to 2011. Key attributes include the date, time, and location of the strike, aircraft type, altitude, phase of flight, and the wildlife species involved.

## Key Findings
- **Frequency of Bird Strikes by Year**: Analysis shows trends in bird strikes over the years, helping to identify periods with higher risk.
- **Altitude and Flight Phase**: Bird strikes are more frequent at lower altitudes, especially during critical flight phases such as takeoff and landing.
- **Impact of Bird Strikes**: Severe impacts are often correlated with lower altitudes and critical flight phases.
- **Aircraft Type**: Certain aircraft types are more prone to bird strikes, indicating potential areas for design or operational improvements.
- **Airlines**: Identifying the airlines most affected by bird strikes can help in focusing mitigation efforts.
- **Airports**: Some airports experience more bird strikes, suggesting the need for targeted bird control measures.
- **Wildlife Species**: Certain species are more frequently involved in bird strikes, which can guide specific wildlife management strategies.

## Visualizations
Some of the key visualizations included in this project are:
- **Frequency of Bird Strikes by Year**: A line chart showing the trend of bird strikes over the years.
- **Bird Strikes by Flight Phase and Altitude**: A scatter plot illustrating the correlation between altitude and the impact of bird strikes.
- **Altitude Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of bird strikes at different altitudes.
- **Bird Strikes by Aircraft Type**: A pie chart highlighting the distribution of bird strikes across different aircraft types.
- **Top 10 US Airlines with Most Bird Strikes**: A bar plot identifying the airlines with the highest number of bird strikes.
- **Bird Strikes by Airport**: A bar plot showing the number of bird strikes at different airports.
- **Bird Strikes by Wildlife Species**: A bar plot highlighting the wildlife species most frequently involved in bird strikes.
- **Heatmap of Bird Strikes by Flight Phase and Altitude**: A heatmap visualizing the density of bird strikes at different altitudes and flight phases.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provides a thorough analysis of bird strikes data, offering insights that can help in developing effective strategies for mitigating bird strikes and enhancing aviation safety. By leveraging data science techniques, we can better understand the risk factors associated with bird strikes and implement targeted measures to reduce their occurrence.
